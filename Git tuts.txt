First to make folder then open that folder with git bash now all work from git bash will be done through that folder
In git bash
$ git init  -> This will make that folder a  .git folder that means now git will took care on that folder(In our case it is in C:\Users\a_moh\OneDrive\Documents\Git Tutorials)
$ git status  -> this will indicate that our git repository is made or not.
$ git add --a  -> this will add all files in our folder as a git file and commit it
$ git commit -m "anything"  ->this will be commited on all files in that folder
$ git log  -> This will showcase the commited lines we used
$ git add first.txt  -> This can be also done insted to add all files like git add --a
$ rm -rf .git  ->This will remove this folder as a git repository
$ pwd  -> Present working directory this command will show
$ ls   -> list content
$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git myhello  -> This repository is from github but i can clone it to my computer by this command and myhello is the folder name of all download
(Ctrl+c is used to stop the processing command)
$ touch erroe.log  -> This will add new file name this in our folder
now if we want to untrack this file or say ignore than
$ touch .gitignore  -> new file added to folder
(In .gitignore write the file name you want to untrack for eg:- error.log)
$ git diff  -> this compare the working directory and staging area
$ git diff --staged  -> This will show the content in the file which is present in our folder
$ git rm first.txt  -> This will delete the file from the folder
$ git mv first.txt first_renamed.txt  -> This will rename the file to first_rename.txt
$ git rm --cached first.txt  -> This will untrack the ignored file(It will not delete the file)
$ git rm first.txt  -> This will delete the file from the folder
$ git log -p  -> This will show the commite or changes made by people in that repository
$ git log --stat  -> this will show the history of chnages in short
$ git log --since=2.days  -> This will show the changes in the repository in 2 days
$ git commit --amed  -> we can change any commite of that repository
$ "git restore --staged <file>..."  ->This will unstage the file

$ git chaeckout -- third.txt  -> This will redo all the changes we made in the file
